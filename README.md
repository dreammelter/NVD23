# SPEEDRUN - A Game Development Workshop

Happy Nevada Day and Halloween, students.

This is a simple platformer game prototype. While it's very rough around the edges and could probably stand to introduce more concepts and techniques, I hope it's enough of a head-start.
Game development is a marathon.

(Unless you're participating in a game jam.)
